    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p> One of the skills that I posses is the ability to play multiple instruments. When I was younger, I was in chorus, violin, flute, recorder and clarinet. A skill that I obtain that I highly value is time management. I think that is one of the most significant skills to have since it helps not only in everyday life but it helps tremendously in school.  </p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>During my free time, I love to read. I’ve been zooming through books and in and out of the library ever since I learned how to read. Something else that I enjoy doing is creative writing. I’ve written about more than 100 excerpts and short stories in total. Something else that I do when I have time is hang out with family and try new things like new restaurants, new attraction places or just work on checking off our bucket list. Besides our many wonderful adventures, sometimes we just hang out at home and add hundred of more inside jokes to our mile long list.

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>Something that interest me very much is law. I find it astonishing how cases vary and differ and how each one has different outcomes. I also am really interested in community work and helping others. Another thing that interest me very much is music. I love all kinds of music and how different they are and how they affect everyone in a different way. Photography has always been really interesting to me. I love how you can capture moments and keep them as memories.Something that interest me very much is law. I find it astonishing how cases vary and differ and how each one has different outcomes.

    <h2>Family</h2>
    <p>Growing up, I was taught that family is always above everything and I still to this day value my family very highly. My mother’s name is Martha Galindo but I call her Linda. On the other hand, my dad’s name is Carlos Galindo. I am the only child but I consider a lot of my relatives as siblings since all of us practically grew up together.</p>
