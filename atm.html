    <h2>6th Grade Learing</h2>
   
    <p>One of the most important skills that I have learned in the atm program is typing. Another really important thing that I learned was welcome to the web which taught me internet safety. On the other hand, I also learned really fun programs like Powerpoint, Microsoft, Excel, Canva,Edmodo,
Tagul, Diamonte, Pixlr and Piktochart. Another thing I learned was how to make Newsletter and how to code art.</p>

Last year I learned some photography techniques but this year I expanded my knowledge even more since I learned more filming techniques.

    <h2>Reflection Of The Program</h2>
    <p>Personally, I love ATM even though it was challenging at times. I’m so glad I chose this program for my elective because it’s a great experience. I learned so many thing that I didn’t know or didn’t think I would ever know. Everything I learned is useful not only for school but useful for the future.
