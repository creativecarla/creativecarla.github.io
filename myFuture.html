    <h2>High School</h2>
    <p>  In the future, I would love to attend Millikan High School. I applied for the QUEST program because I feel I am well suited for it and it interests me very much. I am strongly passionate about the PEACE program as well. To be in either QUEST or PEACE would be terrific. On the other, if I don't get into Millikan, I would love to attend South East High School because of the Media program. </p>

    <h2>College</h2>
    <p>For many years, my dream college has been UCLA. After seeing many relatives graduate and talk about their amazing college experience and the wonderful programs, I’ve been inspired to strive for accomplishing my dream of getting into UCLA. In addition, UCLA has two of my favorite programs; law and writing. Although UCLA is my top choice, Arizona State University has always been next on the list due to their Law, Justice & Public Service program. Ashford University is also one of my top choices for pursuing being an Occupational Therapist. As a final note, no matter which college I end up in, as long as it is one of these three I will be more than happy.

    <h2>Career Interests</h2>
    <p>One of the career paths that I’m currently interested in is Law. One of the factors that makes me adore law so much is I love to debate. Being an Occupational Therapist is also a career choice that I would love to pursue since find it amazing to be able to help improve the wellbeing of others as a job. Also, a more risky but dream job of mine is being an author. I get that it is not a practical paycheck job but it’s something that I aspire to be, even as just a side job.

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>My main goal for the future is to pursue a career that I am very happy in no matter how much time and effort it takes. Along with that goal comes another one; never be in a career field that I am not happy in. Another one of my goals is to go maintain good grades so eventually I don’t have to go to college for 2 years so I could go to University and instead just go straight to University after high school just like my sister.
